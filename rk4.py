def rk4(odefun, tspan, y0, h, params):
    """Uses RK4 Method to calculate the solution to an ODE.

        Parameters
        ----------
        odefun : callable
            A callable function to the derivative function defining the system.
        tspan : array_like
            An array of times (or other independent variable) at which to evaluate
            Euler's Method.  The nTimes values in this array determine the size of
            the outputs.
        y0 : array_like
            Array containing the initial conditions to be used in evaluating the
            odefun.  Must be the same size as that expected for the
            second input of odefun.
        h : step size

        Returns
        -------
        t : ndarray
            t[i] is the ith time (or other independent variable) at which
            the RK4 Method was evaluated.
        y : ndarray
            y[i] is the ith dependent variable at which the RK4 Method was
            evaluated.

        Notes
        -----
        I'm very proud of this function as it should be able to handle any number of equations!
